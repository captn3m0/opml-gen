# opml-gen

Simple web tool to generate OPML files to let you use RSS feeds everywhere

Currently only support GitHub Starred Repos: It generates an OPML file so you can follow all of your starred repos easily.

I plan to add more OPML generators: GoodReads feed perhaps?

The canonical URL for this project is https://git.captnemo.in/nemo/opml-gen,
a [mirror](https://github.com/captn3m0/opml-gen) is maintained on GitHub.
